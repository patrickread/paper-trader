Paper Trader
==================

A paper trading app. Inspired by my long-time use of Google Finance, and my exhaustion with the fact that it has not been supported in years. This is an attempt to reinvent it with some more modern UX concepts involved.

###From the Front to the Back:


 - Material Design
 - Bootstrap
 - NPM
 - Webpack
 - Babel

 - Auth0
 - AWS
   - IAM
   - API Gateway
   - Lambda
   - DynamoDB
 
 
## TODOS

 - Fully flesh out authentication/authorization
 - full backend CRUD for transactions
 - Adding and removing transactions on the front-end
 - Cash deposits/withdraws
 - Graphs
